# GHide

GHide is a Chrome Extension for Google Gemini that adds nested folder organization to the sidebar. It allows you to drag and drop chats into folders, create subfolders, and keep your workspace organized.

## Purpose
This project was built to test AI models and solve a nagging transient problem I have: organizing the growing list of Gemini chats.
