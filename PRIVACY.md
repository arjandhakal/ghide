# Privacy Policy for GHide

**Last Updated:** [Current Date]

GHide ("we", "us", or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our Chrome Extension handles your data.

## 1. Data Collection and Usage

**We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data to external servers.**

*   **Local Storage:** All data related to your folders and chat organization is stored locally on your device using the `chrome.storage.local` API.
*   **No Tracking:** We do not use cookies, analytics, or third-party tracking scripts.
*   **User Identity:** We identify your Google account solely to separate your folder data between different logged-in users (e.g., Personal vs. Work). This identifier (email or ID) remains on your device and is never sent to us.

## 2. Permissions

The extension requires the following permissions to function:

*   **`storage`:** To save your folder structure and chat preferences locally.
*   **Host Permissions (`https://gemini.google.com/*`):** To inject the sidebar organization interface into the Gemini web application.

## 3. Data Sharing

Since we do not collect any data, we have no data to share with third parties, advertisers, or partners.
